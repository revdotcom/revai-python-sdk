    usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is designed to protect a person \
    against rain or sunlight. The term umbrella is traditionally used when protecting oneself from \
    rain, with parasol used when protecting oneself from sunlight, though the terms continue to be \
    used interchangeably. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols \
    are not waterproof, and some umbrellas are transparent. Umbrella canopies may be made of \
    fabric or flexible plastic. There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are \
    called en-tout-cas (French for 'in any case')."
